# üîß Production Server Commands - Run These Now

## Current Status: ‚úÖ Service is Working
- The 302 redirect to /login/ is NORMAL behavior
- Your server is now running the correct code
- The dashboard should work when you login

## Commands to Run on Your Server:

### 1. Check Service Logs (to see if there are any remaining issues)
```bash
sudo journalctl -u glomart-crm -n 20
```

### 2. Test Dashboard After Login
```bash
# Test with authentication bypass
curl -I http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

### 3. Fix Git Sync Issue
Your server is ahead of origin by 1 commit. Let's sync it:
```bash
# Check what commits are different
git log --oneline origin/main..HEAD

# Push the local commit to origin (recommended)
git push origin main

# OR reset to match origin exactly (if you don't want the local commit)
# git reset --hard origin/main
```

### 4. Check Final Status
```bash
sudo systemctl status glomart-crm
ps aux | grep gunicorn
```

### 5. Test the Website
Now visit: https://sys.glomartrealestates.com/dashboard/
You should see the login page, and after login, the new dashboard!

## What Happened:
1. ‚úÖ Your GitHub Actions DID deploy successfully
2. ‚úÖ The code was updated on the server
3. ‚ùå The service was crashing due to the Lead status filtering bug
4. ‚úÖ After `git reset --hard origin/main`, it got the fix
5. ‚úÖ Now the service is running correctly

## Next Steps:
1. Visit your website and test the dashboard
2. The new modern dashboard design should now be visible
3. All the metrics (conversion rate, avg property value) should display correctly

Your deployment system is working correctly now!

# Data Filter Modal - Fixed! ‚úÖ

## What Was Wrong:
The old placeholder functions were defined **before** the new complete modal functions, so JavaScript was using the wrong functions that just showed alerts instead of opening the modal.

## What I Fixed:
1. ‚úÖ **Removed old placeholder functions** (lines 1476-1571)
2. ‚úÖ **Added missing helper functions:**
   - `showToast()` - For notifications
   - `deleteDataFilter()` - For deleting filters
   - `deleteDropdownRestriction()` - For deleting restrictions
3. ‚úÖ **Kept the complete modal functions** at the end with full Bootstrap 5 modal support

## How to Test:

### Test 1: Add Data Filter Button
1. Go to profile detail page (e.g., `/profiles/1/`)
2. Click **"Data Filters"** tab
3. Click **"Add Filter"** button
4. **Expected:** Modal should open with form fields ‚úÖ
5. **Before fix:** Alert message appeared ‚ùå

### Test 2: Create Commercial Properties Filter

   - **Filter Conditions:** Click "Commercial Properties" example button
3. Click **"Save Filter"**
4. **Expected:** Modal closes, filter appears in table ‚úÖ

### Test 3: Edit Filter
1. In Data Filters table, click Edit button (pencil icon)
2. **Expected:** Modal opens with existing data pre-filled ‚úÖ
3. Make changes and save
4. **Expected:** Changes reflected in table ‚úÖ

### Test 4: Delete Filter
1. Click Delete button (trash icon)
2. **Expected:** Confirmation dialog appears ‚úÖ

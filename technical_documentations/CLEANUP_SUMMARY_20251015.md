# System Cleanup Summary - October 15, 2025

## Overview
Comprehensive cleanup of the Glomart CRM project to remove unnecessary files and organize documentation without affecting production functionality.

## Actions Performed

### 1. Documentation Organization ✅
**Moved 8 markdown files from root to `documentation/` directory:**
- `BUGFIX_FIELD_PERMISSIONS.md`
- `CLEANUP_OWNER_MODULE.md`
- `DATA_FILTER_SETUP_GUIDE.md`
- `MODAL_FIX_COMPLETE.md`
- `UNIFIED_PROFILE_EDITOR_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
- `UNIFIED_SYSTEM_MIGRATION.md`
- `VISUAL_FILTER_BUILDER_GUIDE.md`
- `VISUAL_GUIDE.md`

**Result:** All project documentation now centralized in `/documentation/` directory

---

### 2. Test Scripts Removal ✅
**Deleted 7 test/check scripts from `/scripts/` directory:**
- `test_images_production.py`
- `test_db_connection.py`
- `check_images_script.py`
- `create_sample_data.py`
- `check_multiple_images.py`
- `test_local_data.py`
- `test_production_db.py`

**Result:** Removed development/testing utilities not needed in production

---

### 3. Test Management Commands ✅
**Deleted 2 test management commands:**
- `authentication/management/commands/create_test_users.py`
- `authentication/management/commands/test_user_permissions.py`

**Result:** Removed test-only Django management commands

---

### 4. Backup Files Cleanup ✅
**Deleted all .backup files:**
- `real_estate_crm/settings.py.backup`
- `real_estate_crm/settings.py.backup-sqlite`
- `real_estate_crm/settings.py.backup_20251008_102046`
- `real_estate_crm/settings.py.mysql.backup`
- `authentication/context_processors.py.backup`
- `authentication/templates/authentication/partials/sidebar.html.backup`
- `authentication/templates/authentication/dashboard.html.backup`
- `properties/views_backup.py`
- `owner/models.py.backup`
- `owner/models.py.backup2`

**Result:** Removed old backup files - proper backups exist in `/backups/` directory

---

### 5. Empty Test Files ✅
**Deleted empty test files:**
- `owner/tests.py` (contained only default Django boilerplate)

**Result:** Removed unused test framework files

---

### 6. Development Database ✅
**Deleted SQLite database:**
- `db.sqlite3` (development database, production uses MariaDB)

**Result:** Removed unused development database file

---

### 7. Owner Module Folder ✅
**Deleted owner app directory:**
- `/owner/` - Complete Django app folder (models, views, templates, migrations, etc.)
- `/scripts/initialize_owner_databases.py` - Owner database initialization script

**Database Tables Preserved:**
- `owner_ownerdatabase` - 40 records (real estate owner databases)
- `owner_ownerdatabaseaccess` - 21 records (user access logs)

**Reason for Removal:**
- App not registered in `INSTALLED_APPS` (already removed from Django)
- No URL routes configured (not accessible)
- Module record deleted from auth system (see CLEANUP_OWNER_MODULE.md)
- Last activity: September 20, 2025

**Result:** App folder removed, but database tables preserved for potential future use

---

## Files Preserved

### Important Configuration Files (Kept)
- `manage.py` - Django management script
- `gunicorn.py` - Gunicorn production configuration
- `gunicorn.conf.py` - Gunicorn alternate configuration
- `.env.production` - Production environment variables
- `.env.example` - Environment template

### Migration Files (Kept)
All database migration files preserved - these are essential for database schema management

### Production Data (Kept)
- All files in `/backups/` directory
- All files in `/media/` directory (user uploads)
- All files in `/logs/` directory

---

## System Verification

### Testing Results ✅
- **Service Status:** Active and running
- **HTTP Response:** 302 (redirect to login - normal behavior)
- **Gunicorn Workers:** All 3 workers running successfully
- **Port:** 8000 (production)
- **No Import Errors:** All Python modules loading correctly

### User Confirmation
System tested and confirmed working by user after cleanup.

---

## Summary Statistics

### Files Removed
- **Documentation moved:** 8 files
- **Test scripts deleted:** 7 files
- **Management commands deleted:** 2 files
- **Backup files deleted:** 10 files (plus 1 .bak file)
- **Empty test files deleted:** 1 file
- **Development database deleted:** 1 file
- **Owner module deleted:** 1 folder + 1 script

**Total files cleaned:** 31 files/folders

### Space Saved
Approximately 150+ KB of unnecessary files removed from project root and subdirectories.

### Project Structure
- **Before:** Cluttered root directory with mixed documentation and code
- **After:** Clean root directory, all documentation organized in `/documentation/`

---

## Notes
- No production functionality was affected
- All migrations remain intact
- Production backups preserved in `/backups/` directory
- System restarted and verified working
- Events system (LeadEvent model) working correctly after cleanup

---

## Future Recommendations
1. Consider adding `.gitignore` entries for `*.backup`, `*test*.py` (in root), `db.sqlite3`
2. Establish documentation naming convention (all docs in `/documentation/`)
3. Create separate `/tests/` directory if test suite is needed in future
4. Regular cleanup schedule (quarterly) to prevent accumulation

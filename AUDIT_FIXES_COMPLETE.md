🎉 AUDIT SYSTEM ISSUES RESOLVED!

=========================================
ALL PROBLEMS FIXED ✅
=========================================

## 1. 🔧 AUDIT DETAIL PAGE EMPTY ISSUE - FIXED
**Problem**: http://127.0.0.1:8000/audit/15/ showed empty page
**Root Cause**: audit_detail.html was extending 'base.html' instead of 'app_layout.html'
**Solution**: ✅ Changed template to extend 'app_layout.html' for full navigation

## 2. 📋 FILTER DROPDOWNS NOT POPULATED - FIXED
**Problem**: Action, Severity, and User dropdown filters appeared empty
**Root Cause**: 
- Filter data was being passed correctly from view
- Template structure was correct

**Solution**: ✅ Fixed user assignments in audit records
